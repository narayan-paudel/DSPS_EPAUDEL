## Comments about ePaudel's visualization
1. It is not clear what the y axis is plotting. There is no axis label, title, or caption in the read me. The plot could be graphing any number of things, so this is very crucial.
2. The dark blue and dark green are similar colors, so I would recommend choosing two less-similar colors in this visualization. However, different marker shapes are used, which distinguish the series much more noticably.
3. On that note, there are now 2 different graphical features (color, shape) for only 1 data feature (library). There is no need for each series to have a unique marker color *and* shape.
