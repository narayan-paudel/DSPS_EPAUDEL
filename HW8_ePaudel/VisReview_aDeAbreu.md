Clarity: The plot is missing a few graphical elements, including a title, a y-axis label, and a caption/figure label.
A viewer would not be able to know what this plot is trying to display.

Aesthetic: The colors and shapes of the markers work well to easily distinguish between the two sets of data, when checking for 
color-blindness and grey scale requirements. Because there are only two data sets both marker color and shape are not necessary.

Honesty: The data does not seem to be represented dishonestly. 

Suggestions:
1. Consider adding a title, y-axis label, and a figure caption, so that a view can 
understand what the plot is trying to display.

2. Consider removing shape or color from the markers. It is unnessary to have both.

3. consider adding minor axis tick marks on the y-axis so a viewer can see how much 
the data changes from point to point.

Quality: I think the data is displayed well and you can see that there is a clear 
difference between the two datasets.
